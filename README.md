# Python Example: Face Detection and Registration

This project demonstrates face detection and registration using an API. The code sends an image to a remote server, receives face embeddings, and registers them for later use.

## Introduction

In this project, we provide a Python script that takes an input image, sends it to a specified API server for face detection and embedding, and then registers the detected face by saving its embeddings to a file. This is useful for applications such as facial recognition and user authentication.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this code, make sure you have the following:

1. **Python**: You need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Python Libraries**: You will need the following Python libraries, which you can install using pip:

   - `requests`: To make HTTP requests.
   - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
   - `os`: For handling file operations.
   - `cv2` (OpenCV): For image processing.
   - `pickle`: For serialization.

   You can install these libraries using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install requests numpy opencv-python-headless
   ```

3. **API Server**: This code assumes that there is an API server running at a specified URL. Make sure the server is set up and running, and replace `"http://localhost:9900/v1/face2embedding"` with the actual URL of the API server.

4. **Sample Image**: You should have an input image for face detection and registration. Replace the `image_path` variable in the code with the actual path to your image.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-detection-and-registration.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd face-detection-and-registration
   ```

3. Open the Python script (`face_registration.py`) and replace the following placeholders:

   - `"http://localhost:9900/v1/face2embedding"` with the actual URL of the API server.
   - `os.path.join("brainypi-ai-api-examples", "sample_inputs", "images", "face.jpg")` with the actual path to your input image.

## Code Explanation

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. Load the input image using OpenCV.

2. Convert the image to a JPEG format and encode it to bytes.

3. Send a POST request to the API server with the encoded image.

4. If the API response is successful (HTTP status code 200), parse the response JSON and extract face embeddings.

5. Save the face embeddings to a file using the `pickle` module for later use.

6. Display the saved face embeddings.

## Usage

To run the code, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python face_registration.py
```

This will send the input image to the API server, receive face embeddings, and save them to a file.

Feel free to customize the code and adapt it to your specific use case and API endpoints.

## Example

Here's how you can run the code with a sample image:

```bash
python face_registration.py
```

This will demonstrate the face detection and registration process using the provided sample code.
